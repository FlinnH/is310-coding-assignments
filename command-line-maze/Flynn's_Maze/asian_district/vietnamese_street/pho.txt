🍜 Phở - the soul of Vietnamese food!

Savory, aromatic, and deeply comforting—a masterclass in subtle balance.
Star anise, cinnamon, charred ginger, and fish sauce infused into a slow-simmered broth,
brightened with fresh basil, bean sprouts, and a squeeze of lime over flat rice noodles.

CLUE #5: "You're getting warmer! But La Comida Perfecta lies further south.
Cross the border to LATIN FLAVORS and visit the MEXICAN CANTINA!"
