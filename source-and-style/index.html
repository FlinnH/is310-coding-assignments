    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The fortune cookie is a fascinating example of culinary misattribution in American food history. Despite being ubiquitous in Chinese restaurants across the United States, the fortune cookie is actually of Japanese-American origin.</p>
    
    <p>Created in Japanese tea gardens in San Francisco during the early 1900s-1910s, these cookies were inspired by Japanese crackers called "tsujiura senbei." The transformation occurred during and after World War II when Japanese Americans were relocated to internment camps and Chinese-American restaurant owners began producing these cookies. Over time, the fortune cookie became synonymous with Chinese restaurants in America.</p>

    <h2>Key Transformations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cultural transfer from Japanese-American to Chinese-American identity during WWII</li>
        <li>Now strongly associated with American Chinese restaurants despite being unknown in China</li>
        <li>Changed from handmade in tea gardens to mass-produced in factories</li>
        <li>Became an "invented tradition" representing Chinese culture to Americans</li>
    </ul>
